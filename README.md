# ByeEuroBye: Watch Your Money Disappear!

**ByeEuroBye** is a React Native-based finance tracking assistant that helps you manage and track your expenses. With separate tabs for different transaction types (e.g., personal expenses, shared expenses), it keeps all your finances organized.

## Features

- **Summary of Spending:** View total amounts for each category to see where your money is disappearing.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Minimalistic design with easy navigation for an optimal user experience.
- **Fast API Integration:** Sync your transactions with a backend FastAPI service (optional).

## Tech Stack

- **React Native:** Frontend framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
- **AsyncStorage:** Persistent storage for local data.
- **FastAPI (optional):** Backend service for syncing transactions.

## Installation

To run WalletHoudini locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wallethoudini.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## API Integration (Optional)

If you wish to use the FastAPI backend to sync your transactions:

1. Set up your FastAPI backend by following the [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
2. Once your FastAPI server is running, update the `baseUrl` in the API call section of the app to match your FastAPI server's URL.
3. Example API call:

    ```js
    const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/transactions/${username}`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ "transactions": storedTransactions })
    });
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the app and navigate through the tabs to view different categories of expenses.
2. Use the floating "+" button to add new transactions.
3. Edit or delete existing transactions by using the respective buttons beside each item.
4. Keep track of your total spending for each category displayed at the bottom of each tab.
5. Optionally, sync with your FastAPI backend to store transactions in a central database.
